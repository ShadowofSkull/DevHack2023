TLC licenses and regulates over 130,000 vehicles and more than  175,000 drivers, making it the most active taxi and limousine regulatory agency in the United States.  Aside from vehicles and drivers, TLC also regulates taxicab agents and for-hire vehicle bases, including popular app-based transportation services. The TLC plays a pivotal role in furthering public safety within New York City and is a lead agency in a citywide effort to reduce traffic-related injuries.  One of the largest components of TLC\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s operations is the enforcement of agency and administrative code regulations.    The Prosecution Division investigates and prosecutes all summonses issued by TLC which consist of administrative, field and consumer-initiated complaints. Our division prosecutes a wide range of violations including reckless driving, unlicensed operation, illegal street pickups, harassment and leaving the scene of an accident.  Prosecuting Attorneys represent TLC on cases heard before the Hearings Division of the Office of Administrative Trials and Hearings and will gain robust hands-on litigation experience as they rotate through various prosecutorial assignments, including Consumer Intake, Settlements, Hearings and Appeals.

TLC develops and enforces rules to promote safety, transparency, as well as consumer and driver protection for a vital mode of transport in New York City. The vehicles, businesses, and drivers licensed and regulated by the agency move over one million people a day. With the introduction of new apps and technologies, TLC is on the front lines of a changing mobility landscape.  To learn more about the TLC, please visit: www.nyc.gov/taxi. In May 2019, New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio ordered a 45-day review of practices by brokers in the taxi industry.

The review evaluated whether brokers violated existing TLC rules and recommended policy changes to identify and avoid potential broker conflicts and clarify brokers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 duty to act in the best interest of their clients.  TLC is expanding its capacity to conduct ongoing reviews of this nature by creating a new Business Practices Accountability Unit (BPAU).

The analysts will work with other divisions within TLC, including licensing, prosecution and external affairs, on any necessary revisions to the licensure and renewal process, assisting in investigation of rule violations by TLC-licensed businesses, and educating drivers of their rights when working with a TLC-licensed business.
